Scenario: Jerry finally decides he should talk to one of his professors about what kind of skills and other information he would need on his resume to be a strong candidate for a cybersecurity job. The professor, not having enough time to sit down with him, tells Jerry about GoldPath.com and how it can help him answer the questions he has. Jerry creates his account on the website and uploads information about his coursework, any projects he has done, and any job experience that he has.
