# Scenarios

- John, 21, is an average computer science college student. He is extremely knowledgeable about computer science but is concerned about what exactly he will do for a career after college. He asks a friend/classmate about some ideas for what to do to prepare, and the friend tells him about GoldPath.com. John is able to use GoldPath to create and build his resume as he sets up goals and progresses through college in order to prepare him for internships and jobs.
