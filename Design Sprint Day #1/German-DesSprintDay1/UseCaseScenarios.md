## Use Case Scenarios
1. Jeremy, 18, has recently started college. He knows that he wants to work in the tech industry, but is not sure what the requirements are for a successful career path.   
Jeremy starts by vising the "Resume Builder" section of the website, and manually inputs all of the information that he has available like education and skills. He then submits this information so that the model can recommend him with classes and skills needed in the tech industry.  
After the model has been trained, he visits the "Competency Hub" page to understand the requirements better. There, he is able to see which areas of his resume need improvement to increase his chances of success at a company.

2. Olivia, 22, is in her last year of college. Olivia has participated in a number of professional development conferences though her time in college and would like to find a platform where she can gather all of her skills to find the best company to apply for and to connect with recruiters.  
Olivia is a high-achieving student with an impressive resume, so she needs very little help from the Competency Hub. After inputting her resume information, she saw that she ranked as one of the Top 10 candidates for a job at Apple. She then went to the "Networking Center" to connect with recruiters at the company. She was able to submit a connection request with an introductory message and her custom-built resume.
While Olivia waited to connect with recruiters, she used the "Mock Interview" feature to practice some of the most common questions asked by recruiters ar Apple.

3. Hector, 20, is a sophomore in college. Hector recently learned about Gold Path from a networking event. He would like to know how well his skills compare to the skills of his friends when applying to a particular job.
