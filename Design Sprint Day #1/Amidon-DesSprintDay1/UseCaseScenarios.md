Persona: Timothy is an alumni of UNC Charlotte. He is 30 years old and just lost his job. He has a bachelor's degree from the school. He heard that there is a job networking opportunity available through the school.

Scenario: Timothy is an alumni of a prestigious university, and he wants to find a job in his field after his previous company went bankrupt. He has lost many of his professional connections, and is struggling to network by asking his friends about job opportunities. This doesnâ€™t work well since many of his friends worked at the same company that he did and are in the same situation. 

He decides to reach out to a program from his university called GoldPath.com that helps him to network with new companies based on his resume that was automatically generated and matched him with potential employers.
