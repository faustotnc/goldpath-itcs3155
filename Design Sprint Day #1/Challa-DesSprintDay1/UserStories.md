- All of River’s resumes thus far have been niche and precise to graphics programming, making it difficult to find a job. He finds it difficult to find jobs related to graphics programming and also finds it difficult to create a resume to cater to a more broad field of software engineering based on the classes he’s taken. He’s worried that because his masters is in graphics programming he’ll be unable to effectively communicate his broader skills through his resume and find a job. Fortunately he received an email regarding goldpath.com at the time of a career fair. Using GoldPath’s technology and AIs, it was able to link the classes he’s taken to a more applicable resume for a broader context based on his inputs of his job preferences. Additionally after creating the resume it was able to provide him with links to jobs.
