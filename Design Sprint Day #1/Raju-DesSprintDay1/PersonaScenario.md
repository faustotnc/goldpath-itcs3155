# Persona: 
Jess, 22. Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at UNCC. Born in NY, lives in Charlotte. Did an internship. Looking for a job in Data Science. Wants to know what options she has based on her current education.

# Scenario: 

- Using GoldPath.com to find a job after graduation and an internship.

Jess recently graduated from UNCC with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and completed an internship. She was thinking about taking a year to get some more work experience before starting a Masterâ€™s degree either full or part-time depending on what her schedule looks like next year. She creates an account on GoldPath.com and uploads her previous course information by looking at the list of classes she completed on DegreeWorks as well as her previous work experience onto GoldPath.com.

Jess uses the list of acquired skills that GoldPath.com generated for her and finds resume examples that will help her update her current resume with relevant skills and information that will aid her in her search for a new job. She wants to upload her resume to the website and have it stored there so she can edit it whenever she wants to make some more updates. She finds job listings that match her current skill set and starts applying to some positions. She also looks at some other positions that require more skills and finds that she could have acquired those skills by taking a few different classes while she was still a student.

Jess talks to some of her friends that are still CCI students at UNCC and lets them know that they should look into this website before registering for their classes next semester. Since she is open to moving back to NY, Jess wants to filter through her matched positions by location. She applies to several positions and wants to be notified when new positions are available on the website.
